Custom Preset Types
===================

You can actually define your own preset types such as soccer and rescue, and run them through EV3Sim!

I haven't documented this because I'm not sure anyone will read this far. If you do want some information on this however, let me know with an issue on github and I can give you some help as well as populate this page!
