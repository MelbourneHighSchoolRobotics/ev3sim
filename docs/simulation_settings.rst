Simulation Settings
===================

Why do we need settings?
----------------------------

When running a simulation with EV3Sim, you need two things:

* A world to simulate and interact with, and
* Robots to interact with the simulated world.

We can specify both of these things using the two buttons to the right of the ``Soccer`` and ``Rescue`` tabs.

Changing the robots in a simulation
-----------------------------------

Pressing the icon of a robot on the main menu allows you to select the robots present in a simulation.

From here, you can select a bot from those you have defined, and select them for Team 1 or Team 2 for Soccer, or just the individual bot for rescue. For soccer, after selecting the bot for Team 1, Bot 1, you then select the bot for Team 2, Bot 1, and so on.
At any point if you have enough bots in the simulation, you can click "Done" to finish.

Changing simulation settings
----------------------------

Clicking the settings cog instead of the robot button will take you to the settings page for you simulation preset:

To run your simulation with these changes, just click the ``Soccer`` or ``Rescue`` buttons.
